            <h3>Personal Background</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Zack Roland and I am currently a 21 year old 
                undergraduate student at 
                <abbr title="University of California San Diego">UCSD</abbr>. 
                I am from Anaheim (Yay Disneyland!) so I am a SoCal kid 
                through n through. I was raised in a household of all girls 
                so I have been through the warzone and and made it out 
                unscathed. Fortunately, I am not the youngest of my 
                siblings (I beat out my twin sister by 5 mins). She goes to 
                <abbr title="California State University Long Beach">CSULB</abbr>
                so neither of us are too far from home which I know makes my 
                mom happy. I love animals and had a variety of pets from dogs 
                and cats to bunnies and turtles. While I loved them all I would 
                say for sure that I am more of a cat person. I used to be into 
                art and would draw and paint but never had the talent for it 
                compared to my twin. Though we did not grow up with a lot our 
                mom always made sure that we had enough so I owe her the world 
                for that.

            <h3>Academic Background</h3>
            <p>I came into University wanting to pursue a degree 
                in <em>Math and Computer Science</em> and for better or 
                worse, I stuck true to that path with my stubborness 
                refusing to let myself quit no matter how hard it got. I 
                was challenged every step of the way but I knew that if 
                I were to succeed that I would be able to develop into the 
                best version of myself. Over the course of my 4 years I 
                fell in love with math and its various sub-fields. I took 
                courses and have experience in subjects such as; 
                Cryptography, Graph Theory, Number Theory, Linear Algebra, 
                Probability Theory, etc, which thought me how to really 
                think like a mathematician. My Computer Science interests 
                lead to take courses such as; AI Algorithms, Machine 
                Learning, Software Engineering, etc, which thought me how
                to be able to apply my knowledge into real world areas 
                where I could make a genuine impact in.

            <h3>Career Interests</h3>
            <p>My career intrests most closely align to that of 
                a software or machine learning engineer. I desire to be 
                able to develop something that will bring a net positive
                to this world and I want to work for a company that will
                allow me to do that. For me that means that we hold each
                other to high standards in all that we do so that we 
                aren't just popping out junk into the world to make a 
                quick buck. So we build with maintainability, reliability,
                and accessibility in our minds at all time.
